How to:
1) `npm install`
2) `node index.js`


You will see results in console. All logs are "human readable".
Tasks are going in ASC order.


Unfortunately task 2 works without fees collector: collector setup 
commented out in line 39 of `createNonFungibleToken.js`.
Would appreciate the explanation, what provided wrong?
(The error is `INVALID_CUSTOM_FEE_COLLECTOR`)


The 3 task made with extra credit using `hethers.utils.AbiCoder()`.


Task 5 (multisig) not realized (lack of time).
